My name is [Isaak Uchakaev](https://isaak.dev/about/).

Like any other programmer and professional, I love learning new things and technologies, and sometimes, 
I write my thoughts about such things in my personal blog https://isaak.dev, so feel free to [subscribe](https://isaak.dev/subscribe/) to me. 

Also, I have a Telegram channel where I cross-post articles from my blog and post all
the open-source goodies I found: [@the_art_of_development](https://t.me/https://t.me/the_art_of_development).
