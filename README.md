### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Isaak Uchakaev.

I work as a Backend Engineer at [roskomsvoboda](https://github.com/roskomsvoboda).

Like any other programmer and professional, I love learning new things and technologies, and sometimes, 
I write my thoughts about such things in my personal blog https://isaak.dev, so feel free to subscribe to me.

Generally, I work with `Python` and `JavaScript`, but Iâ€™m also familiar with `Erlang`, `Elixir`, 
and `Rust`, so all my activity mainly related to those topics.
