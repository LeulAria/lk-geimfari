My name is Isaak Uchakaev and I'm a Backend Engineer at [roskomsvoboda](https://github.com/roskomsvoboda).

Like any other programmer and professional, I love learning new things and technologies, and sometimes, 
I write my thoughts about such things in my personal blog https://isaak.dev, so feel free to [subscribe](https://isaak.dev/subscribe/) to me.

Generally, I work with `Python` and `JavaScript`, but Iâ€™m also familiar with `Erlang`, `Elixir`, 
and `Rust`, so all my activity mainly related to those topics.

I have a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/isaak_dev) where I cross-post articles from my blog and post all the 
open-source goodies I found: [The Art of Development](https://t.me/isaak_dev)
