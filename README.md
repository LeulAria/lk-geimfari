My name is Isaak Uchakaev.

Like any other programmer and professional, I love learning new things and technologies, and sometimes, 
I write my thoughts about such things in my personal blog https://isaak.dev, so feel free to [subscribe](https://isaak.dev/subscribe/) to me.
Generally, I work with `Python` and `JavaScript`, but I’m also familiar with `Erlang`, `Elixir`, 
and `Rust`, so all my activity mainly related to those topics.

I have a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/https://t.me/the_art_of_development) where I cross-post articles from my blog and post all the 
open-source goodies I found: [The Art of Development](https://t.me/https://t.me/the_art_of_development)
